WAYS TO SELL YOUR BOOKS
1. CONSIGN let ebenta sell it
    Consigning is placing any material in the hand of another, but retaining ownership until the goods are sold or person is transferred.
    How does this work?
        Basically you let ebenta sell your books for you. This is a good option for students who have no time, or students who doesn't want to get involved in any selling activity.
    What do I do?
        You simply give us your item/s, and the right to sell it. We find a decent buyer, sell the item in your behalf, and give you your profits.
    What you should consider.
        Depending on the item you are selling, it may take some time before the item gets sold.
        If such case that you might want to withdraw your item from us, please give us atleast two days to return your item to you.

2. Post a Sell Order
    Another option for sellers to sell their items is by posting a Sell Order in ebenta classified. Potential buyers can search and view post, and eventually purchase items that are for sale
    What do I do?
        You simply start by searching your book in ebenta's library(book database), then post a sell order on that book.
        Once your sell order has been posted, this will be visible in ebenta for 7 days. This means that other users or guests can view your posting thru the browse or search functions.
        note: since we are still starting out, sell/buy order would be visible for 1 Month.
    What you should consider.
        First your should remember that
    Privacy Settings
        User's default privacy settings is set to 'Admin Only', this means contact information of the user is ONLY visible
        to ebenta admins. If this is the case, potential buyers could not directly contact you regarding your sell order. They could however send you a private message thru ebenta, which is really not the fastest way to communicate. Hence we suggest that you update your privacy settings in your profile.

How to Buy Books in eBenta
Buying books in ebenta is designed to be simple and hassle free. Below are the easy steps to purchase a used book.

Step One. Search
    Look for the book that you would like to purchase using our search or browse features. Once you find the book you are looking for, check if ebenta has stocks on the book you are looking for or there are Sell Orders posted under that book by other users. If the book you are looking for is not in ebenta Library, or there are no stocks for that book, you might have to post a buy order.

Step Two. Communicate
    Now that you have found a specific stock or sell order on the book you are interested in, it's time to contact ebenta or the seller. Simply send a message thru SMS, email, or ebenta messaging to us or the seller, stating that you are interested in purchasing the item. 

    Wait for a response, communicate, then agree on the terms of the transaction (i.e mode of payment, meetup location, etc.).

Step Three. Purchase and Receive
    We encourage buyers to pay for the book upon receiving it during meetups. This makes sure that the buyer has the option of not accepting the item, if he or she thinks that the actual condition of the item is not worth the cash. And also for the seller, he or she is assured that the item would be paid for.

Step Four. Feedback
    Once a transaction has been complete, please do send a feedback to the other user. Rating and feedbacks would be beneficial to both parties (buyer and seller) because this would increase the trust level on both parties. Click here to know more about user feedback.
